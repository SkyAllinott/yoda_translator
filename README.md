Uses the [fun translations](https://api.funtranslations.com/) API. 

# Examples of usage
Following is an example workflow a user might see in their terminal.

I wanna get freaky with it     // User Input

Get freaky with it, I wanna    // Output

# Expansions
API contains other "translators", such as minions, cockney accents, etc. May explore adding an option for users to select what translations they want.
